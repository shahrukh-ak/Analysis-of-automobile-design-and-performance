# Analysis-of-automobile-design-and-performance
 The dataset mtcars in R was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and
comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32
automobiles (1973–74 models).<br>
## Objectives:
a. Import the data in R and extract the variables included in the dataset.<br>
b. Install the olsrr package in R and use R code below to draw the Cook’s D bar plot<br>
c. Use ols_plot_cooksd_chart(model) to display the Cook’s D chart<br>
d. Identify the influence diagnostics for each variable using ols_plot_dfbetas(model)<br>
e. Use ols_plot_dffits(model)to check the difference in fits.
